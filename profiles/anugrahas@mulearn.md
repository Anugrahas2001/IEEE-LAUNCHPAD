#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem
- Kerala has a very good future in the feild of technology.
- Now many people understanding the importants of these technologies and they are willing to learn these things.
- But, kerala educational system concentrated in providing more theoretical knowlege to the students than hands on experience.
- I wish that, they have to provide education in more job oriented way and helps the young genration to build skills that are required by the industries and make them available for a good job.
